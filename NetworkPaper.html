                    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: medium">
                    This project was our final project for  our Computing For Analytics course.  
                    We were tasked with selecting a network dataset to apply 5 of the algorithims that we learned in this class.
                    Our dataset comes from the Stanford Large Network Dataset.
                    The dataset is a directed paper citation network that covers all the citations of the 27770 papers (nodes) with 352807 citations (edges). 
                    
                    </p>
                    <h4>Clustering</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: medium">
                    Clustering
                    In this dataset, a cluster could represent a sub-discipline within the high energy physics theory field. 
                    The reasoning behind the clustersâ€™ representation is that if papers are in a same sub-field, their
                    characteristics must be also similar, which is represented in the distance between the nodes. 
                    In addition, papers in a same sub-field will tend to reference each other more than other sub-fields.
                    We used K-Means clustering algorithm to form the clusters as well as the elbow method to decide on the number of clusters.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Betweeness Centrality</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: medium">
                    In this dataset, centrality would be a way to measure the influence of the paper. 
                    We decided to use centrality scores within each cluster to find the most influencial paper in each sub-discipline. 
                    We made the assumption that the most influencial papers would be the ones cited multiple different types of papers. 
                    This assumption is what allowed us to use betweeness centrality as a proxy measure of influence.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Depth First Search</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: medium">
                    The next thing we were interested in was what we called prolific papers. 
                    A prolific paper would be one that spawned many other papers and presented an idea that was continously developed upon. 
                    We assumed this type of paper would produce the greatest number of successor nodes. 
                    Depth first search was used as a proxy for this by getting the depth of a family produced by each paper.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Longest Path</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: medium">
                    We wanted to see if we could predict which papers were on the cutting edge of their field. 
                    We reasoned that a paper's distance from the central node of the cluster would be a good proxy measure of the cutting edge. 
                    To find these values, we used Dijkstra's longest path algorithim. 
                    We ran into some issues with our graph being cyclical, which we assumed could not happen. 
                    We found out that some papers referenced eachother, so we trimmed the graph of all cycle connections.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Linear Program</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: medium">
                    Another insight we wanted to pull was the minimum number of papers someone would need to read in order to get an understanding of a particular subfield as a whole.
                    We only wanted to focus on "important" papers, which we defined as being cited atleast 10 times. 
                    After trimming out each cluster to just those papers, we set up an LP with puLP. 
                    An interesting note, this collection of nodes is refered to as a minimum dominating set. A dominating set is a set of nodes that allows you to travel to any other node in the network.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Things I Would Do Differently</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: medium">
                    Looking back at this project, there a few things that don't sit well with me. 
                    First is the number of clusters we choose for K-means. Looking at the graph now, it really looks like the number of clusters should be 3 from the elbow method.
                    This is made even more apparent when looking at the names of the main papers from cluster 1 and 4.
                    <br>
                    The way of finding cutting edge papers. Looking at it know, I think time should have been incorporated into that analysis. 
                    Without the time part, some of the papers with the longest path's could have been dead-ends, so far out that they can't be worked on further. 
                    We had access to the metadata for each node, but as with most projects, we were on a deadline and had to choose what to focus on and what to cut out.
                    It would have been great to see if we could have followed up with the papers we identified in the future to see if they really became important to the field.
                </p>
